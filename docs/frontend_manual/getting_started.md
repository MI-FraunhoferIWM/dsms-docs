# Getting started

Welcome to the semantics-based data management platform of your project, built on the data space management system (DSMS) technology stack developed by Fraunhofer IWM. This platform can be accessed through a web frontend or programmatically using the DSMS software development kit [DSMS-SDK](https://dsms-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This manual provides comprehensive guidelines for utilizing the web frontend. To effectively navigate the platform, it is essential to familiarize yourself with the naming conventions outlined in the following. Additionally, you will find useful information on how to get in touch and how to cite the platform technology.

For mode information we refer to (our paper)[https://doi.org/10.1002/adem.202401448]. Alternatively, see [the how to cite section](#how-to-cite).

## Naming conventions

### K-items

In our platform, all entities, including individuals, physical devices, organizations, applications, and any relevant information or datasets (such as measurement data or simulation data), are referred to as knowledge-items (abbreviated as k-items). Each k-item is associated with a specific knowledge-type (k-type) and adheres to defined standards, including required fields that must be completed. K-items can be interconnected by establishing links between them.

### K-types

The platform includes several predefined k-types, such as organizations, experts, applications, datasets, and dataset catalogs. While the first four are self-explanatory, dataset catalogs serve to organize datasets, for example for grouping measurement series. Users with administrative privileges can create additional customized k-types. Common examples of these individualized k-types include material specifications, testing machines, or process-specific categories.

## Credentials

To access the platform, you will need valid credentials. These can typically be obtained from Fraunhofer IWM or through the research project you are currently involved in. If you encounter any issues logging in or require credentials, please contact the development team for assistance. Refer to the "Contact" section below for their details.

Administrative rights can be granted by the developers upon request.
