# Additional Tools

Utilize additional tools provided, such as the JupyterHub environment.

- **JupyterHub Environment**: The web frontend includes an integrated JupyterHub environment for script-based development using the DSMS software development kit [DSMS-SDK](https://dsms-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). To access the JupyterHub environment, click on "JupyterLab." 

> ⚠️ We recommend using the integrated JupyterHub environment primarily for testing and demonstration purposes. For development with the DSMS-SDK, it is advisable to install the SDK locally and use your preferred integrated development environment (IDE).
